# insomnia

A frontend for the [hii][hii github] IRC client.

## Status

This is currently under development and I didn't replace my irssi-based
setup with this yet, thus it doesn't have a single user and is likely
full of bugs.

## Dependencies

insomnia depends on the following non-standard utilities:

* [hii][hii github]
* [input][input github]
* [tmux][tmux hompepage] >= [2.9][tmux pr 1487]

## Usage

hii needs to be built by invoking the following command:

	$ make

Afterwards the generated `insomnia` script can be invoked as follows:

	$ ./insomnia irc.hackint.eu '#hii'

This will only work if an `hii` instance for `irc.hackint.eu` is already
running in the background and if the user already joined the `#hii`
channel.
