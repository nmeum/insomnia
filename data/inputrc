# Since version 1.0.0 input(1) uses readline instead of linenoise.
# Unfourtunatly, readline doesn't work in one-line terminals by default.
# This is due to the default values of two settings:
#
#    (1) By default readline completions are displayed above the current
#        input line which is useless in one-line terminals. Instead menu
#        completions (cycling through all available completions) need to
#        be enabled explicitly.
#    (2) By default readline performs line wrapping when input exceeds
#        the current line. This doesn't work in one-line terminals
#        either, instead horizontal scrolling has to be explicitly
#        activated.
#
# I would personally prefer if these issue where addressed by readline
# upstream, i.e. automatically set these option for terminals of height
# one. Upstream accepted a patch for (2) which should be included in
# newer readline versions [1]. I haven't tried proposing a patch for (1)
# yet though. Furthermore, I recently started adding additional readline
# options which are useful in the insomnia context to this file.
