# This script reverse an `out` file. This allows finding the latest
# message of a certain type using grep(1), awk(1), sed(1), â€¦

# There is actually no need to sort the `out` file by timestamp.
# Unfourtunatly, POSIX currently doesn't specify a command line utility
# for reversing an input stream. Therefore we are forced to use sort(1).

# This will change though: http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=877
