## Status

insomnia is just a collection of small programs and scripts which are
connected using tmux to create a simple irssi-like text-based user
interface for hii. As you might expected it's pretty hacky but mostly
works.

## Features

* Support for readline-like key bindings and tab completions for nicks.
* Support for highlight "notification" through bell characters.
	* Use this in combination with tmux's monitor-bell feature.
* Support for tracking topic changes through tmux pane titles.
* Support for colorful output.

## Dependencies

insomnia depends on the following non-standard utilities:

* [hii][hii github] >= 1.0.0
* [input][input github] >= 0.7.0
* [tmux][tmux homepage] >= [2.9][tmux pr 1487]
* awk with `fflush()` (not in [POSIX.1‚Äê2008][posix issue 634])

Additionally, the following software is required for compilation:

* A C99 compiler
* [GNU make][GNU make] (sorry!)

## Installation

To build and install insomnia run the following commands:

	$ make
	$ make install

Consult the `GNUmakefile` for environment variables which can be used to
configure the installation. The variables `LIBDIR` and `DATADIR` are
special and need to be set for both targets `make` and `make install`.

In case you don't want to install insomnia globally but just want to
experiment with it compile insomnia using the following commands:

	$ export LIBDIR="$(pwd)/lib" DATADIR="$(pwd)/data"
	$ make

## Usage

After a successful installation `insomnia` can be invoked as follows:

	$ insomnia irc.hackint.org '#hii'

This will only work if an `hii` instance for `irc.hackint.org` is
already running in the background and if the user already joined the
`#hii` channel.
