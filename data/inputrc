# Since version 1.0.0 input(1) uses readline instead of linenoise.
# Unfourtunatly, readline doesn't work in one-line terminals by default.
# This is due to the default values of two settings:
#
#    (1) By default readline completions are displayed above the current
#        input line which is useless in one-line terminals. Instead menu
#        completions (cycling through all available completions) need to
#        be enabled explicitly.
#    (2) By default readline performs line wrapping when input exceeds
#        the current line. This doesn't work in one-line terminals
#        either, instead horizontal scrolling has to be explicitly
#        activated.
#
# I would personally prefer if these issue where addressed by readline
# upstream, i.e. automatically set these option for terminals of height
# one. Unfortunately upstream seems to be reluctant to automatically
# changing option values [1]. Therefore, insomnia supplies its own
# readline configuration file which (sadly) takes precedence over any
# user supplied configuration files.

# Cycle through completions, don't use multiple lines
"\t": menu-complete

# Use a single line for scrolling
set horizontal-scroll-mode on
